# Data model
This repo contains json schemas of various resources that Sophize's ingester accepts. These definitions are used to generate datamodels for java (Sophize/datamodel-java) and python (Sophize/datamodel-python). For other languages, you may find [quicktype](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype) to be useful.
